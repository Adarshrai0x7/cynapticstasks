GAN is a very interesting part of deep learning.
It amazes me a lot.
This is something that took the most time for me to learn.
Kaggle was taking a lot of time to perform training, so my friends and I configured VS Code to use the GPU of our laptops to perform the training.
I even preferred books to learn more about GANs.
I am attaching some of the images generated by the model.
