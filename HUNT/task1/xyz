I learned a lot while completing this task.
There were so many trials and errors.
Many times, it seemed that the training part went well, but during prediction, it just crushed our hopes.
However, after many attempts, I was finally able to complete it.

My name on Kaggle is Adarsh Rai2007.
I gained a lot of knowledge through this task.
Thank you so much for providing such a great experience!
