This task was quite hard compared to the previous one.
I tried retraining the model by creating a combined training set from Task 1 (both train and test files) and the new training set, but it didn’t work for me.
I wasn’t able to perform any more experiments as a result.
I tried a few other approaches, but the accuracy decreased. Therefore, I am submitting the most recent version of my code.

Thank you for such a good task. It allowed me to learn a lot and gain valuable experience!
