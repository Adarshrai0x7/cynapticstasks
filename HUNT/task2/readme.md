THis task was  quite hard as compared to the last one 
I tried to be train the  model again by making a combine training
set  from the task 1 (both train and test file)and new training set 
but it seems that it doesn't work for me
and i was not able to perform any more such experiment 
i tried some thing but the accuracy decreased i am submitting the most recent code 


Thanks for such a goog task it offer me to learn a lot and get a good experience over the task
